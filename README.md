## Assignment Specific Writeups

<h3>Assignment 1</h3>
<h4>UI/UX Decisions</h4>

For Opportunities, it was decided to try and replicate something similar to [Old Reddit's](https://www.reddit.com) post feed.
The post feed style contains a lot of data that will allow users in future versions
of this project to use functionalities like searching, filtering by keyword, and sorting 
by various custom criteria to find the research project they are interested in. This decision was made because the style of Reddit has been widely copied across many websites on the internet, and this should give our users an intuitive familiarity with the flow and organization of our website.

For Details, it was decided to try and replicate something similar to LinkedIn's Job page, specifically the middle section with the job details. This decision was made because it nicely categorizes information and actions like applying to the job or contacting the poster are visible and easy to do.

<h3>Assignment 2</h3>

Bootstrap improved the site with its reactive properties and modern style. The reactive properties make the website more dynamic in regards to things like screen sizes or device. It also streamlined the creation of
list or table-like properties on the website. 

Bootstrap Components used: NavBar, Jumbotron, Buttons, Rows and Columns, Text input forms, File input forms, various customizing classes (ex: bg-white).

The dropdown menu will pull users' attention to it by showing all of the visitable pages in a list form. The username dropdown with the logout button wasn't specified to be done this way, but it keeps everything user-related encapsulated into one convienient dropdown menu.
